# WELCOME TO THE CFCOUCHBASE SDK

The CFCouchbase SDK is a CFML library for interacting with [Couchbase NoSQL Server](http://www.couchbase.com). It can be used by any CFML application or CFML framework to provide them with NoSQL, distributed caching, dynamic queries and many more capabilities. The CFCouchbase SDK wraps the Couchbase Java SDK and enhances it to provide with a nice dynamic language syntax and usability.

####HONOR GOES TO GOD ABOVE ALL

Because of His grace, this project exists. If you don't like this, then don't read it, its not for you.

>"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ." Romans 5:5

###THE DAILY BREAD

 > "Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister." Romans 14:13
